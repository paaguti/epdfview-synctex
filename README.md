# epdfview-synctex
My original sources for epdfview. Based on epdfview-0.1.8

I have included a rudimentary interface to catch Ctrl-Button1Down and to launch a script that uses synctex and launches an emacsclient. Thereby, we can implement an edit - compile - view cycle for LaTEX.

## TODO
- Auto-refresh after PDF file has changed
## Tested on 
- FreeBSD 10.2 with XFCE
